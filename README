if datetime in bussiness logic is in one timezone, then the tz info can be ignored in the logic layer.
you need to attend to the input/output datetime (e.g. "now", "a given day") and tune it to be in the
"bussiness timezone" (e.g. utcnow + delta).
do separate values for external interaction (e.g. as func args) and internal computation.
